    "If it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirling’s whole\n",
    "life would have been entirely different. She would have gone, with the\n",
    "rest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington’s engagement picnic and Dr. Trent\n",
    "would have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear what\n",
    "happened to her because of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy wakened early, in the lifeless, hopeless hour just preceding\n",
    "dawn. She had not slept very well. One does not sleep well, sometimes,\n",
    "when one is twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community\n",
    "and connection where the unmarried are simply those who have failed to\n",
    "get a man.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless\n",
    "old maidenhood. But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished a\n",
    "certain pitiful, shamed, little hope that Romance would come her way\n",
    "yet—never, until this wet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the\n",
    "fact that she was twenty-nine and unsought by any man.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ay, _there_ lay the sting. Valancy did not mind so much being an old\n",
    "maid. After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn’t possibly be as\n",
    "dreadful as being married to an Uncle Wellington or an Uncle Benjamin,\n",
    "or even an Uncle Herbert. What hurt her was that she had never had a\n",
    "chance to be anything but an old maid. No man had ever desired her.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly\n",
    "greying darkness. She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted\n",
    "to, for two reasons. She was afraid that crying might bring on another\n",
    "attack of that pain around the heart. She had had a spell of it after\n",
    "she had got into bed—rather worse than any she had had yet. And she was\n",
    "afraid her mother would notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at\n",
    "her with minute, persistent, mosquito-like questions regarding the\n",
    "cause thereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Suppose,” thought Valancy with a ghastly grin, “I answered with the\n",
    "plain truth, ‘I am crying because I cannot get married.’ How horrified\n",
    "Mother would be—though she is ashamed every day of her life of her old\n",
    "maid daughter.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But of course appearances should be kept up. “It is not,” Valancy could\n",
    "hear her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, “it is not\n",
    "_maidenly_ to think about _men_.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The thought of her mother’s expression made Valancy laugh—for she had a\n",
    "sense of humour nobody in her clan suspected. For that matter, there\n",
    "were a good many things about Valancy that nobody suspected. But her\n",
    "laughter was very superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled,\n",
    "futile little figure, listening to the rain pouring down outside and\n",
    "watching, with a sick distaste, the chill, merciless light creeping\n",
    "into her ugly, sordid room.\n",
    "\n",
    "She knew the ugliness of that room by heart—knew it and hated it. The\n",
    "yellow-painted floor, with one hideous, “hooked” rug by the bed, with a\n",
    "grotesque, “hooked” dog on it, always grinning at her when she awoke;\n",
    "the faded, dark-red paper; the ceiling discoloured by old leaks and\n",
    "crossed by cracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; the\n",
    "brown-paper lambrequin with purple roses on it; the spotted old\n",
    "looking-glass with the crack across it, propped up on the inadequate\n",
    "dressing-table; the jar of ancient potpourri made by her mother in her\n",
    "mythical honeymoon; the shell-covered box, with one burst corner, which\n",
    "Cousin Stickles had made in her equally mythical girlhood; the beaded\n",
    "pincushion with half its bead fringe gone; the one stiff, yellow chair;\n",
    "the faded old motto, “Gone but not forgotten,” worked in coloured yarns\n",
    "about Great-grand-mother Stirling’s grim old face; the old photographs\n",
    "of ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below. There were\n",
    "only two pictures that were not of relatives. One, an old chromo of a\n",
    "puppy sitting on a rainy doorstep. That picture always made Valancy\n",
    "unhappy. That forlorn little dog crouched on the doorstep in the\n",
    "driving rain! Why didn’t _some one_ open the door and let him in? The\n",
    "other picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving of Queen Louise\n",
    "coming down a stairway, which Aunt Wellington had lavishly given her on\n",
    "her tenth birthday. For nineteen years she had looked at it and hated\n",
    "it, beautiful, smug, self-satisfied Queen Louise. But she never dared\n",
    "destroy it or remove it. Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been\n",
    "aghast, or, as Valancy irreverently expressed it in her thoughts, would\n",
    "have had a fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every room in the house was ugly, of course. But downstairs appearances\n",
    "were kept up somewhat. There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw.\n",
    "Valancy sometimes felt that she could have done something for her room\n",
    "herself, even without money, if she were permitted. But her mother had\n",
    "negatived every timid suggestion and Valancy did not persist. Valancy\n",
    "never persisted. She was afraid to. Her mother could not brook\n",
    "opposition. Mrs. Stirling would sulk for days if offended, with the\n",
    "airs of an insulted duchess.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing Valancy liked about her room was that she could be alone\n",
    "there at night to cry if she wanted to.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for\n",
    "nothing except sleeping and dressing in, were ugly? Valancy was never\n",
    "permitted to stay alone in her room for any other purpose. People who\n",
    "wanted to be alone, so Mrs. Frederick Stirling and Cousin Stickles\n",
    "believed, could only want to be alone for some sinister purpose. But\n",
    "her room in the Blue Castle was everything a room should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy, so cowed and subdued and overridden and snubbed in real life,\n",
    "was wont to let herself go rather splendidly in her day-dreams. Nobody\n",
    "in the Stirling clan, or its ramifications, suspected this, least of\n",
    "all her mother and Cousin Stickles. They never knew that Valancy had\n",
    "two homes—the ugly red brick box of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue\n",
    "Castle in Spain. Valancy had lived spiritually in the Blue Castle ever\n",
    "since she could remember. She had been a very tiny child when she found\n",
    "herself possessed of it. Always, when she shut her eyes, she could see\n",
    "it plainly, with its turrets and banners on the pine-clad mountain\n",
    "height, wrapped in its faint, blue loveliness, against the sunset skies\n",
    "of a fair and unknown land. Everything wonderful and beautiful was in\n",
    "that castle. Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and\n",
    "fire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps,\n",
    "with great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up\n",
    "and down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell\n",
    "and nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that\n",
    "reflected only handsome knights and lovely women—herself the loveliest\n",
    "of all, for whose glance men died. All that supported her through the\n",
    "boredom of her days was the hope of going on a dream spree at night.\n",
    "Most, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of horror if they\n",
    "had known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For one thing she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time.\n",
    "One who wooed her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry\n",
    "and won her after long devotion and many deeds of derring-do, and was\n",
    "wedded to her with pomp and circumstance in the great, banner-hung\n",
    "chapel of the Blue Castle.\n",
    "\n",
    "At twelve, this lover was a fair lad with golden curls and heavenly\n",
    "blue eyes. At fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still\n",
    "necessarily handsome. At twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual. At\n",
    "twenty-five, he had a clean-cut jaw, slightly grim, and a face strong\n",
    "and rugged rather than handsome. Valancy never grew older than\n",
    "twenty-five in her Blue Castle, but recently—very recently—her hero had\n",
    "had reddish, tawny hair, a twisted smile and a mysterious past.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don’t say Valancy deliberately murdered these lovers as she outgrew\n",
    "them. One simply faded away as another came. Things are very convenient\n",
    "in this respect in Blue Castles.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, on this morning of her day of fate, Valancy could not find the key\n",
    "of her Blue Castle. Reality pressed on her too hardly, barking at her\n",
    "heels like a maddening little dog. She was twenty-nine, lonely,\n",
    "undesired, ill-favoured—the only homely girl in a handsome clan, with\n",
    "no past and no future. As far as she could look back, life was drab and\n",
    "colourless, with not one single crimson or purple spot anywhere. As far\n",
    "as she could look forward it seemed certain to be just the same until\n",
    "she was nothing but a solitary, little withered leaf clinging to a\n",
    "wintry bough. The moment when a woman realises that she has nothing to\n",
    "live for—neither love, duty, purpose nor hope—holds for her the\n",
    "bitterness of death.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And I just have to go on living because I can’t stop. I may have to\n",
    "live eighty years,” thought Valancy, in a kind of panic. “We’re all\n",
    "horribly long-lived. It sickens me to think of it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She was glad it was raining—or rather, she was drearily satisfied that\n",
    "it was raining. There would be no picnic that day. This annual picnic,\n",
    "whereby Aunt and Uncle Wellington—one always thought of them in that\n",
    "succession—inevitably celebrated their engagement at a picnic thirty\n",
    "years before, had been, of late years, a veritable nightmare to\n",
    "Valancy. By an impish coincidence it was the same day as her birthday\n",
    "and, after she had passed twenty-five, nobody let her forget it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much as she hated going to the picnic, it would never have occurred to\n",
    "her to rebel against it. There seemed to be nothing of the\n",
    "revolutionary in her nature. And she knew exactly what every one would\n",
    "say to her at the picnic. Uncle Wellington, whom she disliked and\n",
    "despised even though he had fulfilled the highest Stirling aspiration,\n",
    "“marrying money,” would say to her in a pig’s whisper, “Not thinking of\n",
    "getting married yet, my dear?” and then go off into the bellow of\n",
    "laughter with which he invariably concluded his dull remarks. Aunt\n",
    "Wellington, of whom Valancy stood in abject awe, would tell her about\n",
    "Olive’s new chiffon dress and Cecil’s last devoted letter. Valancy\n",
    "would have to look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter\n",
    "had been hers or else Aunt Wellington would be offended. And Valancy\n",
    "had long ago decided that she would rather offend God than Aunt\n",
    "Wellington, because God might forgive her but Aunt Wellington never\n",
    "would.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Alberta, enormously fat, with an amiable habit of always referring\n",
    "to her husband as “he,” as if he were the only male creature in the\n",
    "world, who could never forget that she had been a great beauty in her\n",
    "youth, would condole with Valancy on her sallow skin—\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t know why all the girls of today are so sunburned. When _I_ was\n",
    "a girl my skin was roses and cream. I was counted the prettiest girl in\n",
    "Canada, my dear.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps Uncle Herbert wouldn’t say anything—or perhaps he would remark\n",
    "jocularly, “How fat you’re getting, Doss!” And then everybody would\n",
    "laugh over the excessively humorous idea of poor, scrawny little Doss\n",
    "getting fat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handsome, solemn Uncle James, whom Valancy disliked but respected\n",
    "because he was reputed to be very clever and was therefore the clan\n",
    "oracle—brains being none too plentiful in the Stirling connection—would\n",
    "probably remark with the owl-like sarcasm that had won him his\n",
    "reputation, “I suppose you’re busy with your hope-chest these days?”\n",
    "\n",
    "And Uncle Benjamin would ask some of his abominable conundrums, between\n",
    "wheezy chuckles, and answer them himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What is the difference between Doss and a mouse?\n",
    "\n",
    "“The mouse wishes to harm the cheese and Doss wishes to charm the\n",
    "he’s.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy had heard him ask that riddle fifty times and every time she\n",
    "wanted to throw something at him. But she never did. In the first\n",
    "place, the Stirlings simply did not throw things; in the second place,\n",
    "Uncle Benjamin was a wealthy and childless old widower and Valancy had\n",
    "been brought up in the fear and admonition of his money. If she\n",
    "offended him he would cut her out of his will—supposing she were in it.\n",
    "Valancy did not want to be cut out of Uncle Benjamin’s will. She had\n",
    "been poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness of it. So she\n",
    "endured his riddles and even smiled tortured little smiles over them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Isabel, downright and disagreeable as an east wind, would\n",
    "criticise her in some way—Valancy could not predict just how, for Aunt\n",
    "Isabel never repeated a criticism—she found something new with which to\n",
    "jab you every time. Aunt Isabel prided herself on saying what she\n",
    "thought, but didn’t like it so well when other people said what _they_\n",
    "thought to _her_. Valancy never said what _she_ thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cousin Georgiana—named after her great-great-grand-mother, who had been\n",
    "named after George the Fourth—would recount dolorously the names of all\n",
    "relatives and friends who had died since the last picnic and wonder\n",
    "“which of us will be the first to go next.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Oppressively competent, Aunt Mildred would talk endlessly of her\n",
    "husband and her odious prodigies of babies to Valancy, because Valancy\n",
    "would be the only one she could find to put up with it. For the same\n",
    "reason, Cousin Gladys—really First Cousin Gladys once removed,\n",
    "according to the strict way in which the Stirlings tabulated\n",
    "relationship—a tall, thin lady who admitted she had a sensitive\n",
    "disposition, would describe minutely the tortures of her neuritis. And\n",
    "Olive, the wonder girl of the whole Stirling clan, who had everything\n",
    "Valancy had not—beauty, popularity, love,—would show off her beauty and\n",
    "presume on her popularity and flaunt her diamond insignia of love in\n",
    "Valancy’s dazzled, envious eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There would be none of all this today. And there would be no packing up\n",
    "of teaspoons. The packing up was always left for Valancy and Cousin\n",
    "Stickles. And once, six years ago, a silver teaspoon from Aunt\n",
    "Wellington’s wedding set had been lost. Valancy never heard the last of\n",
    "that silver teaspoon. Its ghost appeared Banquo-like at every\n",
    "subsequent family feast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, yes, Valancy knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she\n",
    "blessed the rain that had saved her from it. There would be no picnic\n",
    "this year. If Aunt Wellington could not celebrate on the sacred day\n",
    "itself she would have no celebration at all. Thank whatever gods there\n",
    "were for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there would be no picnic, Valancy made up her mind that, if the\n",
    "rain held up in the afternoon, she would go up to the library and get\n",
    "another of John Foster’s books. Valancy was never allowed to read\n",
    "novels, but John Foster’s books were not novels. They were “nature\n",
    "books”—so the librarian told Mrs. Frederick Stirling—“all about the\n",
    "woods and birds and bugs and things like that, you know.” So Valancy\n",
    "was allowed to read them—under protest, for it was only too evident\n",
    "that she enjoyed them too much. It was permissible, even laudable, to\n",
    "read to improve your mind and your religion, but a book that was\n",
    "enjoyable was dangerous. Valancy did not know whether her mind was\n",
    "being improved or not; but she felt vaguely that if she had come across\n",
    "John Foster’s books years ago life might have been a different thing\n",
    "for her. They seemed to her to yield glimpses of a world into which she\n",
    "might once have entered, though the door was forever barred to her now.\n",
    "It was only within the last year that John Foster’s books had been in\n",
    "the Deerwood library, though the librarian told Valancy that he had\n",
    "been a well-known writer for several years.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Where does he live?” Valancy had asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Nobody knows. From his books he must be a Canadian, but no more\n",
    "information can be had. His publishers won’t say a word. Quite likely\n",
    "John Foster is a nom de plume. His books are so popular we can’t keep\n",
    "them in at all, though I really can’t see what people find in them to\n",
    "rave over.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think they’re wonderful,” said Valancy, timidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh—well—” Miss Clarkson smiled in a patronising fashion that relegated\n",
    "Valancy’s opinions to limbo, “I can’t say I care much for bugs myself.\n",
    "But certainly Foster seems to know all there is to know about them.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy didn’t know whether she cared much for bugs either. It was not\n",
    "John Foster’s uncanny knowledge of wild creatures and insect life that\n",
    "enthralled her. She could hardly say what it was—some tantalising lure\n",
    "of a mystery never revealed—some hint of a great secret just a little\n",
    "further on—some faint, elusive echo of lovely, forgotten things—John\n",
    "Foster’s magic was indefinable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, she would get a new Foster book. It was a month since she had\n",
    "_Thistle Harvest_, so surely Mother could not object. Valancy had read\n",
    "it four times—she knew whole passages off by heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "And—she almost thought she would go and see Dr. Trent about that queer\n",
    "pain around the heart. It had come rather often lately, and the\n",
    "palpitations were becoming annoying, not to speak of an occasional\n",
    "dizzy moment and a queer shortness of breath. But could she go to see\n",
    "him without telling any one? It was a most daring thought. None of the\n",
    "Stirlings ever consulted a doctor without holding a family council and\n",
    "getting Uncle James’ approval. _Then_, they went to Dr. Ambrose Marsh\n",
    "of Port Lawrence, who had married Second Cousin Adelaide Stirling.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Valancy disliked Dr. Ambrose Marsh. And, besides, she could not get\n",
    "to Port Lawrence, fifteen miles away, without being taken there. She\n",
    "did not want any one to know about her heart. There would be such a\n",
    "fuss made and every member of the family would come down and talk it\n",
    "over and advise her and caution her and warn her and tell her horrible\n",
    "tales of great-aunts and cousins forty times removed who had been “just\n",
    "like that” and “dropped dead without a moment’s warning, my dear.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Aunt Isabel would remember that she had always said Doss looked like a\n",
    "girl who would have heart trouble—“so pinched and peaked always”; and\n",
    "Uncle Wellington would take it as a personal insult, when “no Stirling\n",
    "ever had heart disease before”; and Georgiana would forebode in\n",
    "perfectly audible asides that “poor, dear little Doss isn’t long for\n",
    "this world, I’m afraid”; and Cousin Gladys would say, “Why, _my_ heart\n",
    "has been like that for _years_,” in a tone that implied no one else had\n",
    "any business even to have a heart; and Olive—Olive would merely look\n",
    "beautiful and superior and disgustingly healthy, as if to say, “Why all\n",
    "this fuss over a faded superfluity like Doss when you have _me_?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy felt that she couldn’t tell anybody unless she had to. She felt\n",

    "no need of all the pother that would ensue if she mentioned it. She\n",
    "would just slip up quietly and see Dr. Trent that very day. As for his\n",
    "bill, she had the two hundred dollars that her father had put in the\n",
    "bank for her the day she was born. She was never allowed to use even\n",
    "the interest of this, but she would secretly take out enough to pay Dr.\n",
    "Trent.\n",

    "Dr. Trent was a gruff, outspoken, absent-minded old fellow, but he was\n",
    "a recognised authority on heart disease, even if he were only a general\n",
    "practitioner in out-of-the-world Deerwood. Dr. Trent was over seventy\n",
    "and there had been rumours that he meant to retire soon. None of the\n",
    "Stirling clan had ever gone to him since he had told Cousin Gladys, ten\n",
    "years before, that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed\n",
    "it. You couldn’t patronise a doctor who insulted your\n",
    "first-cousin—once-removed like that—not to mention that he was a\n",
    "Presbyterian when all the Stirlings went to the Anglican church. But\n",
    "Valancy, between the devil of disloyalty to clan and the deep sea of\n",

    "When Cousin Stickles knocked at her door, Valancy knew it was half-past\n",
    "seven and she must get up. As long as she could remember, Cousin\n",
    "Stickles had knocked at her door at half-past seven. Cousin Stickles\n",
    "and Mrs. Frederick Stirling had been up since seven, but Valancy was\n",
    "allowed to lie abed half an hour longer because of a family tradition\n",
    "that she was delicate. Valancy got up, though she hated getting up more\n",
    "this morning than ever she had before. What was there to get up for?\n",
    "Another dreary day like all the days that had preceded it, full of\n",
    "meaningless little tasks, joyless and unimportant, that benefited\n",
    "nobody. But if she did not get up at once she would not be ready for\n",
    "breakfast at eight o’clock. Hard and fast times for meals were the rule\n",
    "in Mrs. Stirling’s household. Breakfast at eight, dinner at one, supper\n",
    "at six, year in and year out. No excuses for being late were ever\n",
    "tolerated. So up Valancy got, shivering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The room was bitterly cold with the raw, penetrating chill of a wet May\n",
    "morning. The house would be cold all day. It was one of Mrs.\n",
    "Frederick’s rules that no fires were necessary after the twenty-fourth\n",
    "of May. Meals were cooked on the little oil-stove in the back porch.\n",
    "And though May might be icy and October frost-bitten, no fires were\n",
    "lighted until the twenty-first of October by the calendar. On the\n",
    "twenty-first of October Mrs. Frederick began cooking over the kitchen\n",
    "range and lighted a fire in the sitting-room stove in the evenings. It\n",
    "was whispered about in the connection that the late Frederick Stirling\n",
    "had caught the cold which resulted in his death during Valancy’s first\n",
    "year of life because Mrs. Frederick would not have a fire on the\n",
    "twentieth of October. She lighted it the next day—but that was a day\n",
    "too late for Frederick Stirling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy took off and hung up in the closet her nightdress of coarse,\n",
    "unbleached cotton, with high neck and long, tight sleeves. She put on\n",
    "undergarments of a similar nature, a dress of brown gingham, thick,\n",
    "black stockings and rubber-heeled boots. Of late years she had fallen\n",
    "into the habit of doing her hair with the shade of the window by the\n",
    "looking-glass pulled down. The lines on her face did not show so\n",
    "plainly then. But this morning she jerked the shade to the very top and\n",
    "looked at herself in the leprous mirror with a passionate determination\n",
    "to see herself as the world saw her.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result was rather dreadful. Even a beauty would have found that\n",
    "harsh, unsoftened side-light trying. Valancy saw straight black hair,\n",
    "short and thin, always lustreless despite the fact that she gave it one\n",
    "hundred strokes of the brush, neither more nor less, every night of her\n",
    "life and faithfully rubbed Redfern’s Hair Vigor into the roots, more\n",
    "lustreless than ever in its morning roughness; fine, straight, black\n",
    "brows; a nose she had always felt was much too small even for her\n",
    "small, three-cornered, white face; a small, pale mouth that always fell\n",
    "open a trifle over little, pointed white teeth; a figure thin and\n",
    "flat-breasted, rather below the average height. She had somehow escaped\n",
    "the family high cheek-bones, and her dark-brown eyes, too soft and\n",
    "shadowy to be black, had a slant that was almost Oriental. Apart from\n",
    "her eyes she was neither pretty nor ugly—just insignificant-looking,\n",
    "she concluded bitterly. How plain the lines around her eyes and mouth\n",
    "were in that merciless light! And never had her narrow, white face\n",
    "looked so narrow and so white.\n",
    "\n",
    "She did her hair in a pompadour. Pompadours had long gone out of\n",
    "fashion, but they had been in when Valancy first put her hair up and\n",
    "Aunt Wellington had decided that she must always wear her hair so.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is the _only_ way that becomes you. Your face is so small that you\n",
    "_must_ add height to it by a pompadour effect,” said Aunt Wellington,\n",
    "who always enunciated commonplaces as if uttering profound and\n",
    "important truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy had hankered to do her hair pulled low on her forehead, with\n",
    "puffs above the ears, as Olive was wearing hers. But Aunt Wellington’s\n",
    "dictum had such an effect on her that she never dared change her style\n",
    "of hairdressing again. But then, there were so many things Valancy\n",
    "never dared do.\n",
    "\n",
    "All her life she had been afraid of something, she thought bitterly.\n",
    "From the very dawn of recollection, when she had been so horribly\n",
    "afraid of the big black bear that lived, so Cousin Stickles told her,\n",
    "in the closet under the stairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "“And I always will be—I know it—I can’t help it. I don’t know what it\n",
    "would be like not to be afraid of something.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Afraid of her mother’s sulky fits—afraid of offending Uncle\n",
    "Benjamin—afraid of becoming a target for Aunt Wellington’s\n",
    "contempt—afraid of Aunt Isabel’s biting comments—afraid of Uncle James’\n",
    "disapproval—afraid of offending the whole clan’s opinions and\n",
    "prejudices—afraid of not keeping up appearances—afraid to say what she\n",
    "really thought of  anything—afraid of poverty in her old age.\n",
    "Fear—fear—fear—she could never escape from it. It bound her and\n",
    "enmeshed her like a spider’s web of steel. Only in her Blue Castle\n",
    "could she find temporary release. And this morning Valancy could not\n",
    "believe she had a Blue Castle. She would never be able to find it\n",
    "again. Twenty-nine, unmarried, undesired—what had she to do with the\n",
    "fairy-like chatelaine of the Blue Castle? She would cut such childish\n",
    "nonsense out of her life forever and face reality unflinchingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "She turned from her unfriendly mirror and looked out. The ugliness of\n",
    "the view always struck her like a blow; the ragged fence, the\n",
    "tumble-down old carriage-shop in the next lot, plastered with crude,\n",
    "violently coloured advertisements; the grimy railway station beyond,\n",
    "with the awful derelicts that were always hanging around it even at\n",
    "this early hour. In the pouring rain everything looked worse than\n",
    "usual, especially the beastly advertisement, “Keep that schoolgirl\n",
    "complexion.” Valancy _had_ kept her schoolgirl complexion. That was\n",
    "just the trouble. There was not a gleam of beauty anywhere—“exactly\n",
    "like my life,” thought Valancy drearily. Her brief bitterness had\n",
    "passed. She accepted facts as resignedly as she had always accepted\n",
    "them. She was one of the people whom life always passes by. There was\n",
    "no altering that fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mood Valancy went down to breakfast.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER III\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakfast was always the same. Oatmeal porridge, which Valancy loathed,\n",
    "toast and tea, and one teaspoonful of marmalade. Mrs. Frederick thought\n",
    "two teaspoonfuls extravagant—but that did not matter to Valancy, who\n",
    "hated marmalade, too. The chilly, gloomy little dining-room was\n",
    "chillier and gloomier than usual; the rain streamed down outside the\n",
    "window; departed Stirlings, in atrocious, gilt frames, wider than the\n",
    "pictures, glowered down from the walls. And yet Cousin Stickles wished\n",
    "Valancy many happy returns of the day!\n",
    "\n",
    "“Sit up straight, Doss,” was all her mother said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy sat up straight. She talked to her mother and Cousin Stickles\n",
    "of the things they always talked of. She never wondered what would\n",
    "happen if she tried to talk of something else. She knew. Therefore she\n",
    "never did it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Frederick was offended with Providence for sending a rainy day\n",
    "when she wanted to go to a picnic, so she ate her breakfast in a sulky\n",
    "silence for which Valancy was rather grateful. But Christine Stickles\n",
    "whined endlessly on as usual, complaining about everything—the weather,\n",
    "the leak in the pantry, the price of oatmeal and butter—Valancy felt at\n",
    "once she had buttered her toast too lavishly—the epidemic of mumps in\n",
    "Deerwood.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Doss will be sure to ketch them,” she foreboded.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Doss must not go where she is likely to catch mumps,” said Mrs.\n",
    "Frederick shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy had never had mumps—or whooping cough—or chicken-pox—or\n",
    "measles—or anything she should have had—nothing but horrible colds\n",
    "every winter. Doss’ winter colds were a sort of tradition in the\n",
    "family. Nothing, it seemed, could prevent her from catching them. Mrs.\n",
    "Frederick and Cousin Stickles did their heroic best. One winter they\n",
    "kept Valancy housed up from November to May, in the warm sitting-room.\n",
    "She was not even allowed to go to church. And Valancy took cold after\n",
    "cold and ended up with bronchitis in June.\n",
    "\n",
    "“None of _my_ family were ever like that,” said Mrs. Frederick,\n",
    "implying that it must be a Stirling tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The Stirlings seldom take colds,” said Cousin Stickles resentfully.\n",
    "_She_ had been a Stirling.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think,” said Mrs. Frederick, “that if a person makes up her mind\n",
    "_not_ to have colds she will not _have_ colds.”\n",
    "\n",
    "So that was the trouble. It was all Valancy’s own fault.\n",
    "\n",
    "But on this particular morning Valancy’s unbearable grievance was that\n",
    "she was called Doss. She had endured it for twenty-nine years, and all\n",
    "at once she felt she could not endure it any longer. Her full name was\n",
    "Valancy Jane. Valancy Jane was rather terrible, but she liked Valancy,\n",
    "with its odd, out-land tang. It was always a wonder to Valancy that the\n",
    "Stirlings had allowed her to be so christened. She had been told that\n",
    "her maternal grandfather, old Amos Wansbarra, had chosen the name for\n",
    "her. Her father had tacked on the Jane by way of civilising it, and the\n",
    "whole connection got out of the difficulty by nicknaming her Doss. She\n",
    "never got Valancy from any one but outsiders.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Mother,” she said timidly, “would you mind calling me Valancy after\n",
    "this? Doss seems so—so—I don’t like it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Frederick looked at her daughter in astonishment. She wore glasses\n",
    "with enormously strong lenses that gave her eyes a peculiarly\n",
    "disagreeable appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What is the matter with Doss?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“It—seems so childish,” faltered Valancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh!” Mrs. Frederick had been a Wansbarra and the Wansbarra smile was\n",
    "not an asset. “I see. Well, it should suit _you_ then. You are childish\n",
    "enough in all conscience, my dear child.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am twenty-nine,” said the dear child desperately.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I wouldn’t proclaim it from the house-tops if I were you, dear,” said\n",
    "Mrs. Frederick. “Twenty-nine! _I_ had been married nine years when I\n",
    "was twenty-nine.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“_I_ was married at seventeen,” said Cousin Stickles proudly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy looked at them furtively. Mrs. Frederick, except for those\n",
    "terrible glasses and the hooked nose that made her look more like a\n",
    "parrot than a parrot itself could look, was not ill-looking. At twenty\n",
    "she might have been quite pretty. But Cousin Stickles! And yet\n",
    "Christine Stickles had once been desirable in some man’s eyes. Valancy\n",
    "felt that Cousin Stickles, with her broad, flat, wrinkled face, a mole\n",
    "right on the end of her dumpy nose, bristling hairs on her chin,\n",
    "wrinkled yellow neck, pale, protruding eyes, and thin, puckered mouth,\n",
    "had yet this advantage over her—this right to look down on her. And\n",
    "even yet Cousin Stickles was necessary to Mrs. Frederick. Valancy\n",
    "wondered pitifully what it would be like to be wanted by some\n",
    "one—needed by some one. No one in the whole world needed her, or would\n",
    "miss anything from life if she dropped suddenly out of it. She was a\n",
    "disappointment to her mother. No one loved her. She had never so much\n",
    "as had a girl friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I haven’t even a gift for friendship,” she had once admitted to\n",
    "herself pitifully.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Doss, you haven’t eaten your crusts,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It rained all the forenoon without cessation. Valancy pieced a quilt.\n",
    "Valancy hated piecing quilts. And there was no need of it. The house\n",
    "was full of quilts. There were three big chests, packed with quilts, in\n",
    "the attic. Mrs. Frederick had begun storing away quilts when Valancy\n",
    "was seventeen and she kept on storing them, though it did not seem\n",
    "likely that Valancy would ever need them. But Valancy must be at work\n",
    "and fancy work materials were too expensive. Idleness was a cardinal\n",
    "sin in the Stirling household. When Valancy had been a child she had\n",
    "been made to write down every night, in a small, hated, black notebook,\n",
    "all the minutes she had spent in idleness that day. On Sundays her\n",
    "mother made her tot them up and pray over them.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this particular forenoon of this day of destiny Valancy spent only\n",
    "ten minutes in idleness. At least, Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles\n",
    "would have called it idleness. She went to her room to get a better\n",
    "thimble and she opened _Thistle Harvest_ guiltily at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The woods are so human,” wrote John Foster, “that to know them one\n",
    "must live with them. An occasional saunter through them, keeping to the\n",
    "well-trodden paths, will never admit us to their intimacy. If we wish\n",
    "to be friends we must seek them out and win them by frequent, reverent\n",
    "visits at all hours; by morning, by noon, and by night; and at all\n",
    "seasons, in spring, in summer, in autumn, in winter. Otherwise we can\n",
    "never really know them and any pretence we may make to the contrary\n",
    "will never impose on them. They have their own effective way of keeping\n",
    "aliens at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere casual\n",
    "sightseers. It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except\n",
    "sheer love of them; they will find us out at once and hide all their\n",
    "sweet, old-world secrets from us. But if they know we come to them\n",
    "because we love them they will be very kind to us and give us such\n",
    "treasures of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any\n",
    "market-place. For the woods, when they give at all, give unstintedly\n",
    "and hold nothing back from their true worshippers. We must go to them\n",
    "lovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn what\n",
    "poignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervals,\n",
    "lying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music are\n",
    "harped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate\n",
    "savours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp\n",
    "brooklands, what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt\n",
    "them. Then the immortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and\n",
    "its subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own forever,\n",
    "so that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet be\n",
    "drawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship.”\n",

    "to her patches; but she felt the strange exhilaration of spirit that\n",
    "always came momentarily to her when she dipped into one of John\n",
    "Foster’s books. Valancy did not know much about woods—except the\n",
    "haunted groves of oak and pine around her Blue Castle. But she had\n",
    "always secretly hankered after them and a Foster book about woods was\n",
    "the next best thing to the woods themselves.\n",

    "Olive never had to wear flannel petticoats. Olive wore ruffled silk and\n",

    "Frederick. But Valancy was gone. She turned at the corner and looked\n",
    "back down the ugly, prim, respectable street where she lived. The\n",
    "Stirling house was the ugliest on it—more like a red brick box than\n",
    "anything else. Too high for its breadth, and made still higher by a\n",
    "bulbous glass cupola on top. About it was the desolate, barren peace of\n",
    "an old house whose life is lived.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a very pretty little house, with leaded casements and dubbed\n",
    "gables, just around the corner—a new house, one of those houses you\n",
    "love the minute you see them. Clayton Markley had built it for his\n",
    "bride. He was to be married to Jennie Lloyd in June. The little house,\n",
    "it was said, was furnished from attic to cellar, in complete readiness\n",
    "for its mistress.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t envy Jennie the man,” thought Valancy sincerely—Clayton\n",
    "Markley was not one of her many ideals—“but I _do_ envy her the house.\n",
    "It’s such a nice young house. Oh, if I could only have a house of my\n",
    "own—ever so poor, so tiny—but my own! But then,” she added bitterly,\n",
    "“there is no use in yowling for the moon when you can’t even get a\n",
    "tallow candle.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In dreamland nothing would do Valancy but a castle of pale sapphire. In\n",
    "real life she would have been fully satisfied with a little house of\n",
    "her own. She envied Jennie Lloyd more fiercely than ever today. Jennie\n",
    "was not so much better looking than she was, and not so very much\n",
    "younger. Yet she was to have this delightful house. And the nicest\n",
    "little Wedgwood teacups—Valancy had seen them; an open fireplace, and\n",
    "monogrammed linen; hemstitched tablecloths, and china-closets. Why did\n",
    "_everything_ come to some girls and _nothing_ to others? It wasn’t\n",
    "fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy was once more seething with rebellion as she walked along, a\n",
    "prim, dowdy little figure in her shabby raincoat and three-year-old\n",
    "hat, splashed occasionally by the mud of a passing motor with its\n",
    "insulting shrieks. Motors were still rather a novelty in Deerwood,\n",
    "though they were common in Port Lawrence, and most of the summer\n",
    "residents up at Muskoka had them. In Deerwood only some of the smart\n",

    "the Stirling clan had as yet condescended to a motor, though Olive was\n",

    "like big purring beasts that might turn and crush you—or make some\n",
    "terrible savage leap somewhere. On the steep mountain trails around her\n",
    "Blue Castle only gaily caparisoned steeds might proudly pace; in real\n",
    "life Valancy would have been quite contented to drive in a buggy behind\n",
    "a nice horse. She got a buggy drive only when some uncle or cousin\n",
    "remembered to fling her “a chance,” like a bone to a dog.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course she must buy the tea in Uncle Benjamin’s grocery-store. To\n",
    "buy it anywhere else was unthinkable. Yet Valancy hated to go to Uncle\n",
    "Benjamin’s store on her twenty-ninth birthday. There was no hope that\n",
    "he would not remember it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why,” demanded Uncle Benjamin, leeringly, as he tied up her tea, “are\n",
    "young ladies like bad grammarians?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy, with Uncle Benjamin’s will in the background of her mind, said\n",
    "meekly, “I don’t know. Why?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Because,” chuckled Uncle Benjamin, “they can’t decline matrimony.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The two clerks, Joe Hammond and Claude Bertram, chuckled also, and\n",
    "Valancy disliked them a little more than ever. On the first day Claude\n",
    "Bertram had seen her in the store she had heard him whisper to Joe,\n",
    "“Who is that?” And Joe had said, “Valancy Stirling—one of the Deerwood\n",
    "old maids.” “Curable or incurable?” Claude had asked with a snicker,\n",
    "evidently thinking the question very clever. Valancy smarted anew with\n",
    "the sting of that old recollection.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Twenty-nine,” Uncle Benjamin was saying. “Dear me, Doss, you’re\n",
    "dangerously near the second corner and not even thinking of getting\n",
    "married yet. Twenty-nine. It seems impossible.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Uncle Benjamin said an original thing. Uncle Benjamin said, “How\n",
    "time does fly!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“_I_ think it _crawls_,” said Valancy passionately. Passion was so\n",
    "alien to Uncle Benjamin’s conception of Valancy that he didn’t know\n",
    "what to make of her. To cover his confusion, he asked another conundrum\n",
    "as he tied up her beans—Cousin Stickles had remembered at the last\n",
    "moment that they must have beans. Beans were cheap and filling.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What two ages are apt to prove illusory?” asked Uncle Benjamin; and,\n",
    "not waiting for Valancy to “give it up,” he added, “Mir-age and\n",
    "marriage.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“M-i-r-a-g-e is pronounced _mirazh_,” said Valancy shortly, picking up\n",
    "her tea and her beans. For the moment she did not care whether Uncle\n",
    "Benjamin cut her out of his will or not. She walked out of the store\n",
    "while Uncle Benjamin stared after her with his mouth open. Then he\n",
    "shook his head.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Poor Doss is taking it hard,” he said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy was sorry by the time she reached the next crossing. Why had\n",
    "she lost her patience like that? Uncle Benjamin would be annoyed and\n",
    "would likely tell her mother that Doss had been impertinent—“to\n",
    "_me_!”—and her mother would lecture her for a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ve held my tongue for twenty years,” thought Valancy. “Why couldn’t\n",
    "I have held it once more?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it was just twenty, Valancy reflected, since she had first been\n",
    "twitted with her loverless condition. She remembered the bitter moment\n",
    "perfectly. She was just nine years old and she was standing alone on\n",
    "the school playground while the other little girls of her class were\n",
    "playing a game in which you must be chosen by a boy as his partner\n",
    "before you could play. Nobody had chosen Valancy—little, pale,\n",
    "black-haired Valancy, with her prim, long-sleeved apron and odd,\n",
    "slanted eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh,” said a pretty little girl to her, “I’m so sorry for you. You\n",
    "haven’t got a beau.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy had said defiantly, as she continued to say for twenty years,\n",
    "“I don’t _want_ a beau.” But this afternoon Valancy once and for all\n",
    "stopped saying that.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’m going to be honest with myself anyhow,” she thought savagely.\n",
    "“Uncle Benjamin’s riddles hurt me because they are true. I _do_ want to\n",
    "be married. I want a house of my own—I want a husband of my own—I want\n",
    "sweet, little fat _babies_ of my own—” Valancy stopped suddenly aghast\n",
    "at her own recklessness. She felt sure that Rev. Dr. Stalling, who\n",
    "passed her at this moment, read her thoughts and disapproved of them\n",
    "thoroughly. Valancy was afraid of Dr. Stalling—had been afraid of him\n",
    "ever since the Sunday, twenty-three years before, when he had first\n",
    "come to St. Albans’. Valancy had been too late for Sunday School that\n",
    "day and she had gone into the church timidly and sat in their pew. No\n",
    "one else was in the church—nobody except the new rector, Dr. Stalling.\n",
    "Dr. Stalling stood up in front of the choir door, beckoned to her, and\n",
    "said sternly, “Little boy, come up here.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy had stared around her. There was no little boy—there was no one\n",
    "in all the huge church but herself. This strange man with the blue\n",
    "glasses couldn’t mean her. She was not a boy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Little boy,” repeated Dr. Stalling, more sternly still, shaking his\n",
    "forefinger fiercely at her, “come up here at once!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy arose as if hypnotised and walked up the aisle. She was too\n",
    "terrified to do anything else. What dreadful thing was going to happen\n",
    "to her? What _had_ happened to her? Had she actually turned into a boy?\n",
    "She came to a stop in front of Dr. Stalling. Dr. Stalling shook his\n",
    "forefinger—such a long, knuckly forefinger—at her and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Little boy, take off your hat.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy took off her hat. She had a scrawny little pigtail hanging down\n",
    "her back, but Dr. Stalling was short-sighted and did not perceive it.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Little boy, go back to your seat and _always_ take off your hat in\n",
    "church. _Remember_!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy went back to her seat carrying her hat like an automaton.\n",
    "Presently her mother came in.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Doss,” said Mrs. Stirling, “what do you mean by taking off your hat?\n",
    "Put it on instantly!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy put it on instantly. She was cold with fear lest Dr. Stalling\n",
    "should immediately summon her up front again. She would have to go, of\n",
    "course—it never occurred to her that one could disobey the rector—and\n",
    "the church was full of people now. Oh, what would she do if that\n",
    "horrible, stabbing forefinger were shaken at her again before all those\n",
    "people? Valancy sat through the whole service in an agony of dread and\n",
    "was sick for a week afterwards. Nobody knew why—Mrs. Frederick again\n",
    "bemoaned herself of her delicate child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Stalling found out his mistake and laughed over it to Valancy—who\n",
    "did not laugh. She never got over her dread of Dr. Stalling. And now to\n",
    "be caught by him on the street corner, thinking such things!\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy got her John Foster book—_Magic of Wings_. “His latest—all\n",
    "about birds,” said Miss Clarkson. She had almost decided that she would\n",
    "go home, instead of going to see Dr. Trent. Her courage had failed her.\n",
    "She was afraid of offending Uncle James—afraid of angering her\n",
    "mother—afraid of facing gruff, shaggy-browed old Dr. Trent, who would\n",
    "probably tell her, as he had told Cousin Gladys, that her trouble was\n",
    "entirely imaginary and that she only had it because she liked to have\n",
    "it. No, she would not go; she would get a bottle of Redfern’s Purple\n",
    "Pills instead. Redfern’s Purple Pills were the standard medicine of the\n",
    "Stirling clan. Had they not cured Second Cousin Geraldine when five\n",
    "doctors had given her up? Valancy always felt very sceptical concerning\n",
    "the virtues of the Purple Pills; but there _might_ be something in\n",
    "them; and it was easier to take them than to face Dr. Trent alone. She\n",
    "would glance over the magazines in the reading-room a few minutes and\n",
    "then go home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy tried to read a story, but it made her furious. On every page\n",
    "was a picture of the heroine surrounded by adoring men. And here was\n",
    "she, Valancy Stirling, who could not get a solitary beau! Valancy\n",
    "slammed the magazine shut; she opened _Magic of Wings_. Her eyes fell\n",
    "on the paragraph that changed her life.\n",
    "\n",
    "“_Fear is the original sin_,” wrote John Foster. “_Almost all the evil\n",
    "in the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of\n",
    "something_. It is a cold, slimy serpent coiling about you. It is\n",
    "horrible to live with fear; and it is of all things degrading.”\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordeal was not so dreadful, after all. Dr. Trent was as gruff and\n",
    "abrupt as usual, but he did not tell her ailment was imaginary. After\n",
    "he had listened to her symptoms and asked a few questions and made a\n",
    "quick examination, he sat for a moment looking at her quite intently.\n",
    "Valancy thought he looked as if he were sorry for her. She caught her\n",
    "breath for a moment. Was the trouble serious? Oh, it couldn’t be,\n",
    "surely—it really hadn’t bothered her _much_—only lately it had got a\n",
    "little worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Trent opened his mouth—but before he could speak the telephone at\n",
    "his elbow rang sharply. He picked up the receiver. Valancy, watching\n",
    "him, saw his face change suddenly as he listened,\n",
    "“‘Lo—yes—yes—_what_?—yes—yes”—a brief interval—“My God!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Trent dropped the receiver, dashed out of the room and upstairs\n",
    "without even a glance at Valancy. She heard him rushing madly about\n",
    "overhead, barking out a few remarks to somebody—presumably his\n",
    "housekeeper. Then he came tearing downstairs with a club bag in his\n",
    "hand, snatched his hat and coat from the rack, jerked open the street\n",
    "door and rushed down the street in the direction of the station.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy sat alone in the little office, feeling more absolutely foolish\n",
    "than she had ever felt before in her life. Foolish—and humiliated. So\n",
    "this was all that had come of her heroic determination to live up to\n",
    "John Foster and cast fear aside. Not only was she a failure as a\n",
    "relative and non-existent as a sweetheart or friend, but she was not\n",
    "even of any importance as a patient. Dr. Trent had forgotten her very\n",
    "presence in his excitement over whatever message had come by the\n",
    "telephone. She had gained nothing by ignoring Uncle James and flying in\n",
    "the face of family tradition.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a moment she was afraid she was going to cry. It _was_ all\n",
    "so—ridiculous. Then she heard Dr. Trent’s housekeeper coming down the\n",
    "stairs. Valancy rose and went to the office door.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The doctor forgot all about me,” she said with a twisted smile.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, that’s too bad,” said Mrs. Patterson sympathetically. “But it\n",
    "wasn’t much wonder, poor man. That was a telegram they ’phoned over\n",
    "from the Port. His son has been terribly injured in an auto accident in\n",
    "Montreal. The doctor had just ten minutes to catch the train. I don’t\n",
    "know what he’ll do if anything happens to Ned—he’s just bound up in the\n",
    "boy. You’ll have to come again, Miss Stirling. I hope it’s nothing\n",
    "serious.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oh, no, nothing serious,” agreed Valancy. She felt a little less\n",
    "humiliated. It was no wonder poor Dr. Trent had forgotten her at such a\n",
    "moment. Nevertheless, she felt very flat and discouraged as she went\n",
    "down the street.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy went home by the short-cut of Lover’s Lane. She did not often\n",
    "go through Lover’s Lane—but it was getting near supper-time and it\n",
    "would never do to be late. Lover’s Lane wound back of the village,\n",
    "under great elms and maples, and deserved its name. It was hard to go\n",
    "there at any time and not find some canoodling couple—or young girls in\n",
    "pairs, arms intertwined, earnestly talking over their little secrets.\n",
    "Valancy didn’t know which made her feel more self-conscious and\n",
    "uncomfortable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evening she encountered both. She met Connie Hale and Kate Bayley,\n",
    "in new pink organdy dresses with flowers stuck coquettishly in their\n",
    "glossy, bare hair. Valancy had never had a pink dress or worn flowers\n",
    "in her hair. Then she passed a young couple she didn’t know, dandering\n",
    "along, oblivious to everything but themselves. The young man’s arm was\n",
    "around the girl’s waist quite shamelessly. Valancy had never walked\n",
    "with a man’s arm about her. She felt that she ought to be shocked—they\n",
    "might leave that sort of thing for the screening twilight, at least—but\n",
    "she wasn’t shocked. In another flash of desperate, stark honesty she\n",
    "owned to herself that she was merely envious. When she passed them she\n",
    "felt quite sure they were laughing at her—pitying her—“there’s that\n",
    "queer little old maid, Valancy Stirling. They say she never had a beau\n",
    "in her whole life”—Valancy fairly ran to get out of Lover’s Lane. Never\n",
    "had she felt so utterly colourless and skinny and insignificant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just where Lover’s Lane debouched on the street, an old car was parked.\n",
    "Valancy knew that car well—by sound, at least—and everybody in Deerwood\n",
    "knew it. This was before the phrase “tin Lizzie” had come into\n",
    "circulation—in Deerwood, at least; but if it had been known, this car\n",
    "was the tinniest of Lizzies—though it was not a Ford but an old Grey\n",
    "Slosson. Nothing more battered and disreputable could be imagined.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was Barney Snaith’s car and Barney himself was just scrambling up\n",
    "from under it, in overalls plastered with mud. Valancy gave him a\n",
    "swift, furtive look as she hurried by. This was only the second time\n",
    "she had ever seen the notorious Barney Snaith, though she had heard\n",
    "enough about him in the five years that he had been living “up back” in\n",
    "Muskoka. The first time had been nearly a year ago, on the Muskoka\n",
    "road. He had been crawling out from under his car then, too, and he had\n",
    "given her a cheerful grin as she went by—a little, whimsical grin that\n",
    "gave him the look of an amused gnome. He didn’t look bad—she didn’t\n",
    "believe he was bad, in spite of the wild yarns that were always being\n",
    "told of him. Of course he went tearing in that terrible old Grey\n",
    "Slosson through Deerwood at hours when all decent people were in\n",
    "bed—often with old “Roaring Abel,” who made the night hideous with his\n",
    "howls—“both of them dead drunk, my dear.” And every one knew that he\n",
    "was an escaped convict and a defaulting bank clerk and a murderer in\n",
    "hiding and an infidel and an illegitimate son of old Roaring Abel Gay\n",
    "and the father of Roaring Abel’s illegitimate grandchild and a\n",
    "counterfeiter and a forger and a few other awful things. But still\n",
    "Valancy didn’t believe he was bad. Nobody with a smile like that could\n",
    "be bad, no matter what he had done.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was that night the Prince of the Blue Castle changed from a being of\n",
    "grim jaw and hair with a dash of premature grey to a rakish individual\n",
    "with overlong, tawny hair, dashed with red, dark-brown eyes, and ears\n",
    "that stuck out just enough to give him an alert look but not enough to\n",
    "be called flying jibs. But he still retained something a little grim\n",
    "about the jaw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Barney Snaith looked even more disreputable than usual just now. It was\n",
    "very evident that he hadn’t shaved for days, and his hands and arms,\n",
    "bare to the shoulders, were black with grease. But he was whistling\n",
    "gleefully to himself and he seemed so happy that Valancy envied him.\n",
    "She envied him his light-heartedness and his irresponsibility and his\n",
    "mysterious little cabin up on an island in Lake Mistawis—even his\n",
    "rackety old Grey Slosson. Neither he nor his car had to be respectable\n",
    "and live up to traditions. When he rattled past her a few minutes\n",
    "later, bareheaded, leaning back in his Lizzie at a raffish angle, his\n",
    "longish hair blowing in the wind, a villainous-looking old black pipe\n",
    "in his mouth, she envied him again. Men had the best of it, no doubt\n",
    "about that. This outlaw happy, whatever he was or wasn’t. She, Valancy\n",
    "Stirling, respectable, well-behaved to the last degree, was unhappy and\n",
    "had always been unhappy. So there you were.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy was just in time for supper. The sun had clouded over, and a\n",
    "dismal, drizzling rain was falling again. Cousin Stickles had the\n",
    "neuralgia. Valancy had to do the family darning and there was no time\n",
    "for _Magic of Wings_.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Can’t the darning wait till tomorrow?” she pleaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Tomorrow will bring its own duties,” said Mrs. Frederick inexorably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy darned all the evening and listened to Mrs. Frederick and\n",
    "Cousin Stickles talking the eternal, niggling gossip of the clan, as\n",
    "they knitted drearily at interminable black stockings. They discussed\n",
    "Second Cousin Lilian’s approaching wedding in all its bearings. On the\n",
    "whole, they approved. Second Cousin Lilian was doing well for herself.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Though she hasn’t hurried,” said Cousin Stickles. “She must be\n",
    "twenty-five.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“There have not—fortunately—been many old maids in our connection,”\n",
    "said Mrs. Frederick bitterly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy flinched. She had run the darning needle into her finger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third Cousin Aaron Gray had been scratched by a cat and had\n",
    "blood-poisoning in his finger. “Cats are most dangerous animals,” said\n",
    "Mrs. Frederick. “I would never have a cat about the house.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She glared significantly at Valancy through her terrible glasses. Once,\n",
    "five years ago, Valancy had asked if she might have a cat. She had\n",
    "never referred to it since, but Mrs. Frederick still suspected her of\n",
    "harbouring the unlawful desire in her heart of hearts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Valancy sneezed. Now, in the Stirling code, it was very bad form\n",
    "to sneeze in public.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You can always repress a sneeze by pressing your finger on your upper\n",
    "lip,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Half-past nine o’clock and so, as Mr. Pepys would say, to bed. But\n",
    "First Cousin Stickles’ neuralgic back must be rubbed with Redfern’s\n",
    "Liniment. Valancy did that. Valancy always had to do it. She hated the\n",
    "smell of Redfern’s Liniment—she hated the smug, beaming, portly,\n",
    "be-whiskered, be-spectacled picture of Dr. Redfern on the bottle. Her\n",
    "fingers smelled of the horrible stuff after she got into bed, in spite\n",
    "of all the scrubbing she gave them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy’s day of destiny had come and gone. She ended it as she had\n",

    "CHAPTER VII\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a rosebush on the little Stirling lawn, growing beside the\n",
    "gate. It was called “Doss’s rosebush.” Cousin Georgiana had given it to\n",
    "Valancy five years ago and Valancy had planted it joyfully. She loved\n",
    "roses. But—of course—the rosebush never bloomed. That was her luck.\n",
    "Valancy did everything she could think of and took the advice of\n",
    "everybody in the clan, but still the rosebush would not bloom. It\n",
    "throve and grew luxuriantly, with great leafy branches untouched of\n",
    "rust or spider; but not even a bud had ever appeared on it. Valancy,\n",
    "looking at it two days after her birthday, was filled with a sudden,\n",
    "overwhelming hatred for it. The thing wouldn’t bloom: very well, then,\n",
    "she would cut it down. She marched to the tool-room in the barn for her\n",
    "garden knife and she went at the rosebush viciously. A few minutes\n",
    "later horrified Mrs. Frederick came out to the verandah and beheld her\n",
    "daughter slashing insanely among the rosebush boughs. Half of them were\n",
    "already strewn on the walk. The bush looked sadly dismantled.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Doss, what on earth are you doing? Have you gone crazy?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“No,” said Valancy. She meant to say it defiantly, but habit was too\n",
    "strong for her. She said it deprecatingly. “I—I just made up my mind to\n",
    "cut this bush down. It is no good. It never blooms—never will bloom.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“That is no reason for destroying it,” said Mrs. Frederick sternly. “It\n",
    "was a beautiful bush and quite ornamental. You have made a\n",
    "sorry-looking thing of it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Rose trees should _bloom_,” said Valancy a little obstinately.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Don’t argue with _me_, Doss. Clear up that mess and leave the bush\n",
    "alone. I don’t know what Georgiana will say when she sees how you have\n",
    "hacked it to pieces. Really, I’m surprised at you. And to do it without\n",
    "consulting _me_!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“The bush is mine,” muttered Valancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What’s that? What did you say, Doss?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I only said the bush was mine,” repeated Valancy humbly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Frederick turned without a word and marched back into the house.\n",
    "The mischief was done now. Valancy knew she had offended her mother\n",
    "deeply and would not be spoken to or noticed in any way for two or\n",
    "three days. Cousin Stickles would see to Valancy’s bringing-up but Mrs.\n",
    "Frederick would preserve the stony silence of outraged majesty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy sighed and put away her garden knife, hanging it precisely on\n",
    "its precise nail in the tool-shop. She cleared away the severed\n",
    "branches and swept up the leaves. Her lips twitched as she looked at\n",
    "the straggling bush. It had an odd resemblance to its shaken, scrawny\n",

    "“I certainly have made an awful-looking thing of it,” thought Valancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But she did not feel repentant—only sorry she had offended her mother.\n",
    "Things would be so uncomfortable until she was forgiven. Mrs. Frederick\n",
    "was one of those women who can make their anger felt all over a house.\n",
    "Walls and doors are no protection from it.\n",

    "“You’d better go uptown and git the mail,” said Cousin Stickles, when\n",
    "Valancy went in. “_I_ can’t go—I feel all sorter peaky and piny this\n",
    "spring. I want you to stop at the drugstore and git me a bottle of\n",
    "Redfern’s Blood Bitters. There’s nothing like Redfern’s Bitters for\n",
    "building a body up. Cousin James says the Purple Pills are the best,\n",
    "but I know better. My poor dear husband took Redfern’s Bitters right up\n",
    "to the day he died. Don’t let them charge you more’n ninety cents. I\n",

    "\n",
    "She got Cousin Stickles’ bottle of bitters and then she went to the\n",
    "post-office and asked for her mail at the General Delivery. Her mother\n",
    "did not have a box. They got too little mail to bother with it. Valancy\n",
    "did not expect any mail, except the _Christian Times_, which was the\n",
    "only paper they took. They hardly ever got any letters. But Valancy\n",
    "rather liked to stand in the office and watch Mr. Carewe, the\n",
    "grey-bearded, Santa-Clausy old clerk, handing out letters to the lucky\n",
    "people who did get them. He did it with such a detached, impersonal,\n",
    "Jove-like air, as if it did not matter in the least to him what\n",
    "supernal joys or shattering horrors might be in those letters for the\n",
    "people to whom they were addressed. Letters had a fascination for\n",
    "Valancy, perhaps because she so seldom got any. In her Blue Castle\n",
    "exciting epistles, bound with silk and sealed with crimson, were always\n",
    "being brought to her by pages in livery of gold and blue, but in real\n",
    "life her only letters were occasional perfunctory notes from relatives\n",
    "or an advertising circular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently she was immensely surprised when Mr. Carewe, looking even\n",
    "more Jovian than usual, poked a letter out to her. Yes, it was\n",
    "addressed to her plainly, in a fierce, black hand: “Miss Valancy\n",
    "Stirling, Elm Street, Deerwood”—and the postmark was Montreal. Valancy\n",
    "picked it up with a little quickening of her breath. Montreal! It must\n",
    "be from Doctor Trent. He had remembered her, after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy met Uncle Benjamin coming in as she was going out and was glad\n",
    "the letter was safely in her bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "“What,” said Uncle Benjamin, “is the difference between a donkey and a\n",

    "Uncle Benjamin passed in, tremendously pleased with himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cousin Stickles pounced on the _Times_ when Valancy got home, but it\n",
    "did not occur to her to ask if there were any letters. Mrs. Frederick\n",
    "would have asked it, but Mrs. Frederick’s lips at present were sealed.\n",
    "Valancy was glad of this. If her mother had asked if there were any\n",
    "letters Valancy would have had to admit there was. Then she would have\n",
    "had to let her mother and Cousin Stickles read the letter and all would\n",
    "be discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her heart acted strangely on the way upstairs, and she sat down by her\n",
    "window for a few minutes before opening her letter. She felt very\n",
    "guilty and deceitful. She had never before kept a letter secret from\n",
    "her mother. Every letter she had ever written or received had been read\n",
    "by Mrs. Frederick. That had never mattered. Valancy had never had\n",
    "anything to hide. But this _did_ matter. She could not have any one see\n",
    "this letter. But her fingers trembled with a consciousness of\n",
    "wickedness and unfilial conduct as she opened it—trembled a little,\n",
    "too, perhaps, with apprehension. She felt quite sure there was nothing\n",
    "seriously wrong with her heart but—one never knew.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Trent’s letter was like himself—blunt, abrupt, concise, wasting no\n",
    "words. Dr. Trent never beat about the bush. “Dear Miss Sterling”—and\n",
    "then a page of black, positive writing. Valancy seemed to read it at a\n",
    "glance; she dropped it on her lap, her face ghost-white.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Trent told her that she had a very dangerous and fatal form of\n",
    "heart disease—angina pectoris—evidently complicated with an\n",
    "aneurism—whatever that was—and in the last stages. He said, without\n",
    "mincing matters, that nothing could be done for her. If she took great\n",
    "care of herself she might live a year—but she might also die at any\n",
    "moment—Dr. Trent never troubled himself about euphemisms. She must be\n",
    "careful to avoid all excitement and all severe muscular efforts. She\n",
    "must eat and drink moderately, she must never run, she must go upstairs\n",
    "and uphill with great care. Any sudden jolt or shock might be fatal.\n",
    "She was to get the prescription he enclosed filled and carry it with\n",
    "her always, taking a dose whenever her attacks came on. And he was hers\n",
    "truly, H. B. Trent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy sat for a long while by her window. Outside was a world drowned\n",
    "in the light of a spring afternoon—skies entrancingly blue, winds\n",
    "perfumed and free, lovely, soft, blue hazes at the end of every street.\n",
    "Over at the railway station a group of young girls was waiting for a\n",
    "train; she heard their gay laughter as they chattered and joked. The\n",
    "train roared in and roared out again. But none of these things had any\n",
    "reality. Nothing had any reality except the fact that she had only\n",
    "another year to live.\n",
    "\n",
    "When she was tired of sitting at the window she went over and lay down\n",
    "on her bed, staring at the cracked, discoloured ceiling. The curious\n",
    "numbness that follows on a staggering blow possessed her. She did not\n",
    "feel anything except a boundless surprise and incredulity—behind which\n",
    "was the conviction that Dr. Trent knew his business and that she,\n",
    "Valancy Stirling, who had never lived, was about to die.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the gong rang for supper Valancy got up and went downstairs\n",
    "mechanically, from force of habit. She wondered that she had been let\n",
    "alone so long. But of course her mother would not pay any attention to\n",
    "her just now. Valancy was thankful for this. She thought the quarrel\n",
    "over the rosebush had been really, as Mrs. Frederick herself might have\n",
    "said, Providential. She could not eat anything, but both Mrs. Frederick\n",
    "and Cousin Stickles thought this was because she was deservedly unhappy\n",
    "over her mother’s attitude, and her lack of appetite was not commented\n",
    "on. Valancy forced herself to swallow a cup of tea and then sat and\n",
    "watched the others eat, with an odd feeling that years had passed since\n",
    "she had sat with them at the dinner-table. She found herself smiling\n",
    "inwardly to think what a commotion she could make if she chose. Let her\n",
    "merely tell them what was in Dr. Trent’s letter and there would be as\n",
    "much fuss made as if—Valancy thought bitterly—they really cared two\n",
    "straws about her.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Dr. Trent’s housekeeper got word from him today,” said Cousin\n",
    "Stickles, so suddenly that Valancy jumped guiltily. Was there anything\n",
    "in thought waves? “Mrs. Judd was talking to her uptown. They think his\n",
    "son will recover, but Dr. Trent wrote that if he did he was going to\n",
    "take him abroad as soon as he was able to travel and wouldn’t be back\n",
    "here for a year at least.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“That will not matter much to _us_,” said Mrs. Frederick majestically.\n",
    "“He is not _our_ doctor. I would not”—here she looked or seemed to look\n",
    "accusingly right through Valancy—“have _him_ to doctor a sick cat.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“May I go upstairs and lie down?” said Valancy faintly. “I—I have a\n",
    "headache.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What has given you a headache?” asked Cousin Stickles, since Mrs.\n",
    "Frederick would not. The question had to be asked. Valancy could not be\n",
    "allowed to have headaches without interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You ain’t in the habit of having headaches. I hope you’re not taking\n",
    "the mumps. Here, try a spoonful of vinegar.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Piffle!” said Valancy rudely, getting up from the table. She did not\n",
    "care just then if she were rude. She had had to be so polite all her\n",
    "life.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it had been possible for Cousin Stickles to turn pale she would\n",
    "have. As it was not, she turned yellower.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Are you sure you ain’t feverish, Doss? You sound like it. You go and\n",
    "get right into bed,” said Cousin Stickles, thoroughly alarmed, “and\n",
    "I’ll come up and rub your forehead and the back of your neck with\n",
    "Redfern’s Liniment.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy had reached the door, but she turned. “I won’t be rubbed with\n",
    "Redfern’s Liniment!” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cousin Stickles stared and gasped. “What—what do you mean?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I said I wouldn’t be rubbed with Redfern’s Liniment,” repeated\n",
    "Valancy. “Horrid, sticky stuff! And it has the vilest smell of any\n",
    "liniment I ever saw. It’s no good. I want to be left alone, that’s\n",
    "all.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy went out, leaving Cousin Stickles aghast.\n",
    "\n",
    "“She’s feverish—she _must_ be feverish,” ejaculated Cousin Stickles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mrs. Frederick went on eating her supper. It did not matter whether\n",

    "CHAPTER VIII\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy did not sleep that night. She lay awake all through the long\n",
    "dark hours—thinking—thinking. She made a discovery that surprised her:\n",
    "she, who had been afraid of almost everything in life, was not afraid\n",
    "of death. It did not seem in the least terrible to her. And she need\n",
    "not now be afraid of anything else. Why had she been afraid of things?\n",
    "Because of life. Afraid of Uncle Benjamin because of the menace of\n",
    "poverty in old age. But now she would never be old—neglected—tolerated.\n",
    "Afraid of being an old maid all her life. But now she would not be an\n",
    "old maid very long. Afraid of offending her mother and her clan because\n",
    "she had to live with and among them and couldn’t live peaceably if she\n",
    "didn’t give in to them. But now she hadn’t. Valancy felt a curious\n",
    "freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "But she was still horribly afraid of one thing—the fuss the whole\n",
    "jamfry of them would make when she told them. Valancy shuddered at the\n",
    "thought of it. She couldn’t endure it. Oh, she knew so well how it\n",
    "would be. First there would be indignation—yes, indignation on the part\n",
    "of Uncle James because she had gone to a doctor—any doctor—without\n",
    "consulting HIM. Indignation on the part of her mother for being so sly\n",
    "and deceitful—“to your own mother, Doss.” Indignation on the part of\n",
    "the whole clan because she had not gone to Dr. Marsh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then would come the solicitude. She would be taken to Dr. Marsh, and\n",
    "when Dr. Marsh confirmed Dr. Trent’s diagnosis she would be taken to\n",
    "specialists in Toronto and Montreal. Uncle Benjamin would foot the bill\n",
    "with a splendid gesture of munificence in thus assisting the widow and\n",
    "orphan, and talk forever after of the shocking fees specialists charged\n",
    "for looking wise and saying they couldn’t do anything. And when the\n",
    "specialists could do nothing for her Uncle James would insist on her\n",
    "taking Purple Pills—“I’ve known them to effect a cure when _all_ the\n",
    "doctors had given up”—and her mother would insist on Redfern’s Blood\n",
    "Bitters, and Cousin Stickles would insist on rubbing her over the heart\n",
    "every night with Redfern’s Liniment on the grounds that it _might_ do\n",
    "good and _couldn’t_ do harm; and everybody else would have some pet\n",
    "dope for her to take. Dr. Stalling would come to her and say solemnly,\n",
    "“You are very ill. Are you prepared for what may be before you?”—almost\n",
    "as if he were going to shake his forefinger at her, the forefinger that\n",
    "had not grown any shorter or less knobbly with age. And she would be\n",
    "watched and checked like a baby and never let do anything or go\n",
    "anywhere alone. Perhaps she would not even be allowed to sleep alone\n",
    "lest she die in her sleep. Cousin Stickles or her mother would insist\n",
    "on sharing her room and bed. Yes, undoubtedly they would.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was this last thought that really decided Valancy. She could not put\n",
    "up with it and she wouldn’t. As the clock in the hall below struck\n",
    "twelve Valancy suddenly and definitely made up her mind that she would\n",
    "not tell anybody. She had always been told, ever since she could\n",
    "remember, that she must hide her feelings. “It is not ladylike to have\n",
    "feelings,” Cousin Stickles had once told her disapprovingly. Well, she\n",
    "would hide them with a vengeance.\n",
    "\n",
    "But though she was not afraid of death she was not indifferent to it.\n",
    "She found that she _resented_ it; it was not fair that she should have\n",
    "to die when she had never lived. Rebellion flamed up in her soul as the\n",
    "dark hours passed by—not because she had no future but because she had\n",
    "no past.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’m poor—I’m ugly—I’m a failure—and I’m near death,” she thought. She\n",
    "could see her own obituary notice in the Deerwood _Weekly Times_,\n",
    "copied into the Port Lawrence _Journal_. “A deep gloom was cast over\n",
    "Deerwood, etc., etc.”—“leaves a large circle of friends to mourn, etc.,\n",
    "etc., etc.”—lies, all lies. Gloom, forsooth! Nobody would miss her. Her\n",
    "death would not matter a straw to anybody. Not even her mother loved\n",
    "her—her mother who had been so disappointed that she was not a boy—or\n",
    "at least, a pretty girl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy reviewed her whole life between midnight and the early spring\n",
    "dawn. It was a very drab existence, but here and there an incident\n",
    "loomed out with a significance out of all proportion to its real\n",
    "importance. These incidents were all unpleasant in one way or another.\n",
    "Nothing really pleasant had ever happened to Valancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ve never had one wholly happy hour in my life—not one,” she thought.\n",
    "“I’ve just been a colourless nonentity. I remember reading somewhere\n",
    "once that there is an hour in which a woman might be happy all her life\n",
    "if she could but find it. I’ve never found my hour—never, never. And I\n",
    "never will now. If I could only have had that hour I’d be willing to\n",
    "die.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Those significant incidents kept bobbing up in her mind like unbidden\n",
    "ghosts, without any sequence of time or place. For instance, that time\n",
    "when, at sixteen, she had blued a tubful of clothes too deeply. And the\n",
    "time when, at eight, she had “stolen” some raspberry jam from Aunt\n",
    "Wellington’s pantry. Valancy never heard the last of those two\n",
    "misdemeanours. At almost every clan gathering they were raked up\n",
    "against her as jokes. Uncle Benjamin hardly ever missed re-telling the\n",
    "raspberry jam incident—he had been the one to catch her, her face all\n",
    "stained and streaked.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I have really done so few bad things that they have to keep harping on\n",
    "the old ones,” thought Valancy. “Why, I’ve never even had a quarrel\n",
    "with any one. I haven’t an enemy. What a spineless thing I must be not\n",
    "to have even one enemy!”\n",
    "\n",
    "There was that incident of the dust-pile at school when she was seven.\n",
    "Valancy always recalled it when Dr. Stalling referred to the text, “To\n",
    "him that hath shall be given and from him that hath not shall be taken\n",
    "even that which he hath.” Other people might puzzle over that text but\n",
    "it never puzzled Valancy. The whole relationship between herself and\n",
    "Olive, dating from the day of the dust-pile, was a commentary on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "She had been going to school a year, but Olive, who was a year younger,\n",
    "had just begun and had about her all the glamour of “a new girl” and an\n",
    "exceedingly pretty girl at that. It was at recess and all the girls,\n",
    "big and little, were out on the road in front of the school making\n",
    "dust-piles. The aim of each girl was to have the biggest pile. Valancy\n",
    "was good at making dust-piles—there was an art in it—and she had secret\n",
    "hopes of leading. But Olive, working off by herself, was suddenly\n",
    "discovered to have a larger dust-pile than anybody. Valancy felt no\n",
    "jealousy. Her dust-pile was quite big enough to please her. Then one of\n",
    "the older girls had an inspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Let’s put all our dust on Olive’s pile and make a tremendous one,” she\n",
    "exclaimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A frenzy seemed to seize the girls. They swooped down on the dust-piles\n",
    "with pails and shovels and in a few seconds Olive’s pile was a\n",
    "veritable pyramid. In vain Valancy, with scrawny, outstretched little\n",
    "arms, tried to protect hers. She was ruthlessly swept aside, her\n",
    "dust-pile scooped up and poured on Olive’s. Valancy turned away\n",
    "resolutely and began building another dust-pile. Again a bigger girl\n",
    "pounced on it. Valancy stood before it, flushed, indignant, arms\n",
    "outspread.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Don’t take it,” she pleaded. “Please don’t take it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“But _why_?” demanded the older girl. “Why won’t you help to build\n",
    "Olive’s bigger?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I want my own little dust-pile,” said Valancy piteously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Her plea went unheeded. While she argued with one girl another scraped\n",
    "up her dust-pile. Valancy turned away, her heart swelling, her eyes\n",
    "full of tears.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Jealous—you’re jealous!” said the girls mockingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "“You were very selfish,” said her mother coldly, when Valancy told her\n",
    "about it at night. That was the first and last time Valancy had ever\n",
    "taken any of her troubles to her mother.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy was neither jealous nor selfish. It was only that she wanted a\n",
    "dust-pile of her own—small or big mattered not. A team of horses came\n",
    "down the street—Olive’s dust pile was scattered over the roadway—the\n",
    "bell rang—the girls trooped into school and had forgotten the whole\n",
    "affair before they reached their seats. Valancy never forgot it. To\n",
    "this day she resented it in her secret soul. But was it not symbolical\n",
    "of her life?\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ve never been able to have my own dust-pile,” thought Valancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enormous red moon she had seen rising right at the end of the\n",
    "street one autumn evening of her sixth year. She had been sick and cold\n",
    "with the awful, uncanny horror of it. So near to her. So big. She had\n",
    "run in trembling to her mother and her mother had laughed at her. She\n",
    "had gone to bed and hidden her face under the clothes in terror lest\n",
    "she might look at the window and see that horrible moon glaring in at\n",
    "her through it.\n",

    "The boy who had tried to kiss her at a party when she was fifteen. She\n",
    "had not let him—she had evaded him and run. He was the only boy who had\n",
    "ever tried to kiss her. Now, fourteen years later, Valancy found\n",
    "herself wishing that she had let him.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time she had been made to apologise to Olive for something she\n",
    "hadn’t done. Olive had said that Valancy had pushed her into the mud\n",
    "and spoiled her new shoes _on purpose_. Valancy knew she hadn’t. It had\n",
    "been an accident—and even that wasn’t her fault—but nobody would\n",
    "believe her. She had to apologise—and kiss Olive to “make up.” The\n",
    "injustice of it burned in her soul tonight.\n",
    "\n",
    "That summer when Olive had the most beautiful hat, trimmed with creamy\n",
    "yellow net, with a wreath of red roses and little ribbon bows under the\n",
    "chin. Valancy had wanted a hat like that more than she had ever wanted\n",
    "anything. She pleaded for one and had been laughed at—all summer she\n",
    "had to wear a horrid little brown sailor with elastic that cut behind\n",
    "her ears. None of the girls would go around with her because she was so\n",
    "shabby—nobody but Olive. People had thought Olive so sweet and\n",
    "unselfish.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I was an excellent foil for her,” thought Valancy. “Even then she knew\n",
    "that.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Valancy had tried to win a prize for attendance in Sunday School once.\n",
    "But Olive won it. There were so many Sundays Valancy had to stay home\n",
    "because she had colds. She had once tried to “say a piece” in school\n",
